# Mohamed Elfaki - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Mohamed! I have a multidisciplinary background in Engineering and Management, with a strong passion for data analytics and visualization. Currently, I work as a Data Analyst, leveraging tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Alteryx to transform complex datasets into actionable insights.

Through my education and professional journey, I have developed a solid foundation in data engineering, dashboard development, and workflow automation. My experience includes creating interactive visualizations, maintaining data pipelines, and collaborating with stakeholders to drive data-informed decisions. These projects highlight my ability to bridge technical expertise with business needs effectively.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new tools, techniques, and methodologies in data science to continuously expand my skill set. I am motivated by the challenge of uncovering meaningful insights from data and translating them into impactful solutions.

Feel free to browse through my projects and see how I am leveraging data to solve real-world problems. [My CV](https://github.com/MoElsamani/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/blob/main/Mohamed%20Elfaki%20CV-en.pdf) is also available for reference.


This repository is a curated space where I showcase my skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
